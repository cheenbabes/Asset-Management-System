The following is a list of damage statuses for assets. In order to maintain
internal consistency, the items on this list should be used to populate the
damage_loss_theft columns of the assets and assets_events tables, as well as
the note_category column of asset_notes. Additionally, this list of values
should be used for any part of the application that reads from or writes to
the above mentioned columns as certain parts of the app will read these values
and take action based on the result.
